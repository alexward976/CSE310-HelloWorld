# Overview

This is about as simple as it can get. The software showcases JavaScript's ability to output to a web page's console. I make use of this ability by outputting the undying greeting: Hello World!

Though I have some good experience using JS, sometimes it's good to get down to the nitty-gritty of how simple the language can be.

# Development Environment

This was developed in Visual Studio Code. In order to display the output, I needed to host an HTML page locally. I did that using VS Code's "Live Sever" extension, which hosts the site on port 5500.

JavaScript is a phenomenal language for web development. It makes a web user's experience with a page interactive, improving their overall experience.
